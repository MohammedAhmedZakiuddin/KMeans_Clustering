# K-Means Clustering Project

# Overview:
This project is an implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm from scratch in Python. It takes a dataset as input and clusters the data points into K clusters.

# Prerequisites:
Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (version 3.1.0) </br>
Any other libraries or packages required (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib)

# Getting Started:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
2. Install the required dependencies.
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the K-means algorithm on the dataset: </br>
   python KMeans.py ClusteringData.txt K </br>
Replace ClusteringData.txt with the path to your dataset file and K with the number of clusters you want to create.

# Usage:
Example 1: Run K-means with the default value of K (2 clusters) </br>
python KMeans.py ClusteringData.txt </br>

Example 2: Run K-means with K=3 </br>
python KMeans.py ClusteringData.txt 3 </br>

# Visualization:

Image 1: Round 1 of the clustering.
Image 2: An intermediate round during clustering.
Image 3: Final result after clustering completion.
