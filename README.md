# K-Means Clustering Project

# Overview:
This project is an implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm from scratch in Python. It takes a dataset as input and clusters the data points into K clusters.

# Prerequisites:
Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (version 3.1.0) </br>
Any other libraries or packages required (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib)

# Getting Started:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
2. Install the required dependencies.
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the K-means algorithm on the dataset: </br>
   python KMeans.py ClusteringData.txt K </br>
Replace ClusteringData.txt with the path to your dataset file and K with the number of clusters you want to create.

# Description:

1. Implemented the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch in Python for a machine learning project.
2. Developed a Python executable file, KMeans.py, which takes a dataset and performs K-Means clustering with a user-defined number of clusters.
3. Created visualizations to illustrate the clustering process, including initial clusters, intermediate states, and the final clustering result.
4. Demonstrated strong data analysis and machine learning skills by experimenting with different values of K to observe the impact on clustering.
5. Collaborated with team members to complete the project and met deadlines effectively.

# Usage:
Example 1: Run K-means with the default value of K (2 clusters) </br>
python KMeans.py ClusteringData.txt </br>

Example 2: Run K-means with K=3 </br>
python KMeans.py ClusteringData.txt 3 </br>

# Visualization:

Image 1: Round 1 of the clustering. </br> 
Image 2: An intermediate round during clustering. </br>
Image 3: Final result after clustering completion. </br>
